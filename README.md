# Map Editor

MapEditor exercise @ <Academia de CÃ³digo_> Using SimpleGFX Library and practicing with bidimensional arrays.

Use arrows to navigate the cells. While you press the Space key you will paint or unpaint the cells.

The project is still not finished, still want to implement a saving feature with basic Java I/O mechanisms to read and write from file using a BufferedReader and Writer.
